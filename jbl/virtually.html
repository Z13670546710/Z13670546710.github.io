                            <p>Released in 2001, "Spirited Away" tells the story of Chihiro, a 10-year-old girl who enters a world of spirits after her parents are transformed into pigs. She must work at a bathhouse for spirits to find a way to free herself and her parents.</p>
                        <p>The film explores themes of identity, courage, environmentalism, and the contrast between traditional values and modern consumerism. It remains Studio Ghibli's most commercially successful film and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.</p>
                        <p>The bathhouse setting serves as a microcosm of Japanese society, with its strict hierarchy and emphasis on hard work, while also incorporating elements of Shinto beliefs about spirits and purification.</p>
