                   <p>With the continuous development of internet technology, short-video platforms have become a popular means of communication. As a short-video social platform, Douyin (TikTok) has rapidly emerged as one of the world's most widely used short-video applications with the largest user base within just a few years, serving as a key marketing channel for numerous brands and enterprises. Taking Douyin as a case study, this paper explores the operational models of short-video platforms in the new media environment, analyzes their advantages and disadvantages, and proposes corresponding suggestions and countermeasures. First, it expounds on the changes in user needs, technological methods, and business models against the backdrop of the new media era. Then, it analyzes the user characteristics, content features, and business models of the Douyin platform. Finally, it summarizes the reasons behind Douyin's success and its future development trends.</p>

                    <p>Communication is a social interactive behavior for human information exchange. From ancient beacon fires to today's internet, media has continuously evolved, yet humanity's need to transmit information has always driven its development. For the discipline of public administration, communication permeates the management process—whether in conveying information or mediating conflicts—mastering communication theories and techniques is of great importance. The research object of communication studies is social information systems and their operational laws. The normal functioning of social systems relies on information dissemination, as seen in social phenomena such as policy adjustments amid changing national conditions or shifts in corporate production, both of which are closely intertwined with communication.</p>
                    <p>In the current era of information overload, short videos have become a primary carrier, but issues such as uneven content quality persist. It is essential to apply 所学 (what we have learned) to analyze communication phenomena, cultivate information filtering capabilities, and ensure that high-quality content stands out. This also provides new directions for future career development.</p>
