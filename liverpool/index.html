                The rapid evolution of wireless communications and the advent of 6G demands a paradigm shift in antenna design. Static, rigid hardware is giving way to dynamic, adaptable, and intelligent systems capable of meeting the demands of ultra-high reliability, low latency, and massive connectivity. This workshop, “Liquid Antennas for Reconfigurable and Intelligent Wireless Systems,” is positioned at the forefront of this transformation. It provides a holistic reference for the latest research, focusing on liquid antennas as a key enabler within the broader framework of next-generation reconfigurable wireless technologies.

            <p class="abstract-text">
                The focus is to explore the entire value chain from soft-matter physics to AI-driven control algorithms. At the material level, we will delve into the science, fabrication, and modeling of liquid antennas, whose inherent flexibility and stretchability make them ideal for next-generation wireless communication devices. Building on this physical foundation, we expand our scope to the broader paradigm of the Fluid Antenna System (FAS), where these and other software-controllable structures—such as RF pixels and metasurfaces—reconfigure shape, position, and radiation characteristics. Unlike traditional antennas, the fine spatial resolution of FAS unlocks unprecedented performance gains. The aim is to foster a vibrant dialogue among material scientists, antenna engineers, and communication theorists, catalyzing collaborations that will define the future of wireless front-ends.
