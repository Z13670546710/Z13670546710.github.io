            <div class="h_title">Seal script: the beauty of the ancient and elegant origin</div>
            <p class="h_con">Seal script is one of the oldest forms of Chinese calligraphy, divided into large seal script and small seal script. Dazhuan script is commonly seen in bronze inscriptions from the Shang and Zhou dynasties (such as inscriptions on gold and stone drums), with thick strokes and free structure; The small seal script was unified and standardized by Li Si of the Qin Dynasty, with round and symmetrical lines and rigorous and symmetrical structure, such as Mount Taishan Stone Carving. Although seal script is no longer commonly used for daily writing, its ancient and elegant style is still widely used in seal carving and calligraphy creation, carrying the memory of the origin of Chinese civilization.</p>

            <div class="h_title">Lishu: The Transformation from Complex to Simple</div>
            <p class="h_con">Lishu emerged during the Qin and Han dynasties and was a key script for the transition of Chinese characters from seal script to regular script. Its characteristic is the "silkworm head and tailcoat" - the starting stroke is rounded like a silkworm head, and the ending stroke is stretched like a tailcoat, as in the Eastern Han Dynasty's "Cao Quan Stele". Lishu simplified the complex lines of seal script, enhanced writing efficiency, and became a commonly used font in official documents. Its emergence marked the shift of Chinese characters from pictographic to symbolic, and had a profound impact on later generations of regular script and running script.</p>

              <div class="h_title">Regular script: a model of square and dignified writing</div>
              <p class="h_con">Kaishu was formed in the Wei and Jin dynasties and matured in the Tang dynasty, represented by masters such as Ouyang Xun, Yan Zhenqing, and Liu Gongquan. Its strokes are straight and the structure is rigorous, like Yan Zhenqing's "Duobao Pagoda Stele" which is majestic and heavy, and Liu Gongquan's "Xuanmi Pagoda Stele" which is strong and robust. Regular script, due to its clarity and regularity, has become the foundation of printing and a compulsory script for beginners in calligraphy. It not only embodies the Confucian aesthetic of "harmony and righteousness", but also contains personal character, and is known as the "model of calligraphy".</p>

            <div class="h_title">Running Script: Smooth and Natural Charm of Interest</div>
            <p class="h_con">Xingshu is between regular script and cursive script, with Wang Xizhi's "Preface to Lanting" as its pinnacle work. Its brushwork is coherent, like flowing clouds and water, with both the recognizability of regular script and the agility of cursive script. During the Song Dynasty, Su Shi, Mi Fu, and others further enriched the style of running script, with some being elegant and graceful, while others were calm and carefree. Xingshu, due to its practicality and artistic value, has become the most popular calligraphy style in daily writing and artistic creation, perfectly interpreting the "beauty of harmony" in Chinese calligraphy.</p>

            <div class="h_title">Cursive Script: Dance of Unrestrained and Unrestrained Heart Images</div>
            <p class="h_con">Cursive script is divided into Zhangcao (fast writing in clerical script) and Jincao (such as Zhang Xu and Huai Su Kuangcao), characterized by simple and concise strokes and continuous lines. Zhang Xu's "Four Ancient Poems" is like a storm, while Huai Su's "Self narration" is like a dragon and snake racing, showcasing the ultimate emotional release. Although cursive script is difficult to distinguish, it is the highest expression of the artistic quality of calligraphy, elevating writing to an abstract expression of the soul's trajectory. It is highly praised by literati and has also influenced modern abstract art.</p>
