              <p>Chinese traditional culture has a long and rich history, accumulating five thousand years of wisdom and civilization. With Confucianism and Taoism as the core, it emphasizes philosophical concepts such as "benevolence", "the Doctrine of the Mean", and "unity of man and nature". In the field of art, calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, opera, poetry, and other forms possess a unique Eastern charm; Festival customs such as Spring Festival, Mid Autumn Festival, and Dragon Boat Festival carry profound connotations of family reunion and natural timing; Food culture emphasizes the harmony of the five flavors, with tea ceremony, porcelain, silk, and other symbols of Chinese civilization. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine, martial arts, Go and other skills still have a profound impact worldwide. Chinese traditional culture not only shapes the spiritual character of the Chinese nation, but also contributes unique value to world civilization.</p>

                    <p>Confucianism is founded by Confucius (551 BC -479 BC), with "benevolence" as its core, emphasizing "self-restraint and restoration of propriety as benevolence" (Analects), and advocating for achieving social harmony through moral cultivation. Mencius developed the theory of "good nature" and put forward the people-oriented idea of "valuing the people over the ruler"; Xunzi advocated the theory of "evil nature" and attached great importance to the education of etiquette and law.</p>
