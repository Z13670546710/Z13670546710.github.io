                        </div>
                        <div class="r-bottom">
                        <p>Lu cuisine originated in Shandong and is the first of the four major cuisines in China. It is mainly salty and fresh, and emphasizes the cooking time and soup art. Classic dishes such as scallion braised sea cucumber and nine round colon demonstrate the delicacy of palace cuisine; Sweet and sour carp embodies the etiquette of Qilu culture. Lu cuisine makes good use of broth to enhance freshness, with techniques including frying, stir frying, grilling, and dipping, which have had an impact throughout North China and even Northeast China. Kong Fu cuisine incorporates the Confucian concept of "never tired of fine food" into cooking, giving food a cultural height.</p>

                           <p>Sichuan cuisine, with Sichuan as its core, is known for its "hundred dishes, hundred flavors", and spicy food is just one of them. Kung Pao chicken's hot paste, fresh boiled cabbage, and fish flavored shredded meat are the complex taste types, showing its taste level. The use of Sichuan peppercorns and chili peppers forms the characteristic of "delicious taste, good spicy aroma", and fermentation processes such as Douban sauce and kimchi add depth to the flavor. Sichuan cuisine has a strong market atmosphere, and derivative formats such as hotpot and skewers have become global symbols of Chinese catering culture.</p>

                        <p>Cantonese cuisine has a wide range of ingredients and pursues its own flavor, embodying the essence of "eating in Guangzhou".

Chaozhou cuisine is good at bittern and cold cooking, and Hakka cuisine has local flavor such as Stuffed tofu.

                    <p>Huaiyang Cuisine centers on Yangzhou and Huai'an, and is famous for its "excellent knife making". Wensi Tofu cuts tofu into thin strips and pierces them with needles, leaving the lion's head soft and tender, showcasing the philosophy of "governing a great country like cooking small delicacies". The light and elegant flavor is in line with the aesthetic of literati, and the Red Chamber Banquet elevates food to art. As the main force of the state banquet, Huaiyang Cuisine conveys the implication and refinement of Chinese culture to the world with the taste aesthetics of "moderation".</p>

                    <p>Fujian cuisine is centered around Fuzhou and incorporates both Hakka and Chaoshan characteristics. "Buddha jumps over the wall" is a collection of delicacies in one altar, reflecting the luxury of "the altar inspires meat and fragrance floating around"; Litchi flesh is shaped like a fruit with a sweet and sour taste, showcasing ingenuity. The unique food customs, such as red lees seasoning, Shaxian snacks, and Sea worm jelly jelly, integrate the traditions of the Central Plains and the marine culture. Fujian cuisine is like a taste map of the Maritime Silk Road, recording the collision of flavors brought by immigration and commerce.
